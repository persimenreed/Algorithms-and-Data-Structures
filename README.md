# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Projects during the course IKT203, where several algorithms were implemented.

## Circular Linked List
A circular linked list was implemented to solve the Josephus Problem. The Josephus Problem is a theoretical problem where the end-goal is to find the last element of a circular list, 
with the condition is that you remove every Kth element while looping through the list until there is only one element left.
The number of elements in the list may vary, and so may K, which means that the last element remaining depends on the input.

## KMP algorithm
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is used to search for patterns(substrings) within a text.
